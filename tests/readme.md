Project Demo:  TodoMVC - Make a simple testing structure that covers all the aspects of the website.

Test cases:

1. Fill and Enter 5 to-do items.
2. Edit an existing to-do item.
3. Mark a to-do as completed.
4. Filter checks.
5. Delete a to-do.
6. Verify persistence after page reload.

Tests must be independent and repeatable
Avoid hard-coded waits
Avoid brittle selectors

7. Empty todo submission
8. Extremely long todo text
9. Rapid add/delete actions
10. Multiple todos with similar names
11. Intentinal Failure, skipped test, known flakiness, unreliable test.
